So, you've got a gap in your team, or an opportunity to expand. Time to hire!
You've read tens or hundreds of job descriptions in your career. You use those
as a template. A paragraph or two about the organization, another couple about
the job, and a list of all the requirements. Done.

Not so fast...

### Is your job description inclusive?

Diversity in your teams matters (I hope I don't need to explain why). A major
factor in creating diverse and inclusive teams is your hiring process, and that
process starts with your job description.

It takes care to write a job description well. That care is more than running it
through language analysers like [Hemmingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/),
[alex](https://alexjs.com/), the
[Gender Decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/), and
[Textio](https://textio.com/). Tools like those will help you write using
simpler, less biased language, but it's more than just your choice of words that
need some thought.

Here are some helpful principles I've learned to use when thinking about hiring.
I'm not an expert, but I have spent a fair amount of time thinking, reading, and
talking about what makes a good, inclusive job description. Please use your own
judgement when applying these, and listen to other voices, especially the voices
of marginalized people.

#### Describe the work, not the person

It can be tempting to include a long list of requirements of a potential
applicant as a way of describing the job. Instead of describing requirements,
describe the work involved in the doing the job. What would this person do every
day? What are the challenges they'll face? Who will they interact and work with?
Who will support their growth and how? Most job descriptions are far too heavy
on the "you" section and have far too little about the role.

For each requirement you're thinking of adding, consider the part of the job
that needs that skill or experience. Instead of writing a requirement of a
person, describe the part of the job that demonstrates its need. Similar to the
principle of "show, don't tell", describing how a skill might be used in
practice provides more context to your future hire than a dry skill description
ever could.

A job description exists to describe the job, not the person filling it. Let a
potential applicant evaluate it for themselves, and decide if it's what they
want and feel qualified to do. The rest of your hiring process exists to see if
you agree.

#### Is it really a requirement?

If you do have a long list of things that someone doing the job needs to know or
have done, ask yourself about each one: is this a requirement? Would someone
without evidenced experience of that skill be unable to do the job? Is it
something they could learn? Does someone need experience with Photoshop, or will
any image editing experience do? Who's more suited to the job: someone with
experience doing a specific thing, but without much flexibility in picking up
new things, or someone who doesn't have that experience but is keen and able to
learn it on the job?

The same thing applies to requirements like: university educated, 3 years of
experience, must have shipped 4 products. What do requirements like these test
for? Is someone with 3 years of experience inherently better than someone with
less? Does a university education give someone an advantage in carrying out the
work involved in the job?

If a job description has a requirement written in it, even if it's a "soft",
non-essential requirement, some underqualified privileged people will push the
limits of that requirement, as career advisors teach them to do, while many
qualified marginalized people won't feel empowered to apply. Assume some
marginalized people will underestimate themselves. They may have been taught
through their experiences that their skills and opinions are seen as less
valuable than their more privileged peers. And if it's written anywhere in the
job description, people might interpret it as a strict requirement, regardless
of how you frame it.

Requirements in job descriptions only exist to exclude people. Let your
screening calls and interviews do that. The more applicants you get, the better
the chance that you hire the best person for the job.

#### Be specific

If you ask for "experience" (and do you really need to â€“ see above?), be
specific about what you mean. Hopefully you know what you mean and have an idea
of how much experience you need (if you don't, how will you be objective?).
Write it down. Tell your applicant what you're really looking for. Different
people will interpret "experience" in different ways. One person might take it
to mean "have you done this thing at least once?" where another might take it as
"do you do this every day?", so remove the ambiguity.

#### Avoid jargon

Use plain language to describe what you mean. It's not uncommon for people,
especially those without formal training in a job role, to know how to do things
without knowing the name for what they're doing. If you use buzzphrases, jargon,
and abbreviations, you're likely to be excluding people who knew everything you
needed except for the terminology.

#### Avoid long lists

Long bulleted lists are intimidating. For many, they can read like checklists or
diagnostic criteria of mounting insecurity, and put people in the mindset of
needing to justify themselves. Bullet points also encourage abbreviations and
jargon (see above), where the candidate would benefit from clear, descriptive
language. Instead of a list, write paragraphs. The more you write, the clearer
your expectations will be (though beware of writing so much that it's a chore to
read).

### What does good look like?

Putting these principles into practice, here's an example of a before and after
for a job description we used for a Service Designer job at dxw. There's always
room for improvement, but hopefully it helps put some of the points into
context.

#### Before

As a service designer, you will work collaboratively with researchers and others
throughout the lifecycle of a project.

As our clients transform into more service-oriented organisations, you will help
them to define their services and develop the user-centred design capabilities
and the ways of working they need.

As part of a multidisciplinary team, you will work closely with service and
product owners, user researchers, business analysts, developers, and others to
transform and improve services.

You will be responsible for crafting hypotheses based on research insights,
leading and designing collaborative workshops, and creating prototypes.

In projects with smaller teams, you may play a dual role as a researcher,
business analyst, or content designer.

You will support other service designers building the service design community
within dxw.

Key skills: Research, synthesis, facilitation, communication and storytelling,
visualisation, prototyping, and empathy. You:

- have some experience working as a practitioner service designer
- can work with empathy and resilience as part of a multidisciplinary, agile
  team, sharing work in progress for early discussion and iteration with your
  team and clients
- understand the need to design public services that work well for all kinds of
  users, across all the channels and support options they need, and the devices
  and assistive technologies they use
- think beyond the design of the product to its ongoing development and support
  required by the organisation, working with service owners to implement
  strategies needed to run a sustainable and successful service
- build effective relationships with all kinds of stakeholders to understand
  desired and acceptable outcomes, from idea generation to adoption of the
  service or product
- identify and find ways to raise risks, issues and areas of uncertainty and
  constructively challenge assumptions about product, service or the
  organisation
- have experience of planning, gathering and synthesising research findings and
  performance data, across end-to-end services
- can combine evidence and experience to create ideas and make good design
  decisions, choosing the most appropriate method for the team, project and
  desired outcome
- are a skilled facilitator and communicator, able to devise and share
  narratives of current service experiences, and visions of future ones
- can create prototypes at appropriate fidelity (visual and physical mockups,
  code) to support experiments and tests

### A job description is only part of it

There's so much more to diverse and inclusive hiring than a job description. To
make a truly inclusive hiring process, you also need to think about where you
advertise, any bias you have in your interviewing processes, understanding who
your applicants are and learning from the lack of diversity, and a whole host of
other things. But a job description sits early in the hiring pipeline. Getting
it right unlocks the opportunity for more people to apply, and hopefully,
gradually a more diverse team.
