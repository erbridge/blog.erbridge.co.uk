description:
  Weeknotes are an opportunity to reflect on the past week and look forward to
  the next one. Mine reflect on both my personal and my professional life, so
  expect a mixture of software stuff, video games, public sector work, existing
  as a trans person, tabletop roleplaying, and whatever else claims my
  attention.

### git branching

I often find myself not sure which branch is the base branch on projects. We use
a variety of branch names at dxw (we're part way through renaming `master` to
`main` and some projects use `develop` as their active branch, too). I made a
quick Git alias so I don't have to think about it.

```ini
# ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
	default = !git checkout $(git rev-parse --verify --quiet develop && echo "develop" || git rev-parse --verify --quiet main && echo "main" || echo "master")
```

[bob](https://twitter.com/rjw1) then pointed out a better solution:

```ini
# ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
	default = !git checkout $(git default-branch)
	default-branch = !git remote show origin | awk '/HEAD branch/ {print $NF}'
```

Nice!

### iso27001

It's audit time. I mostly watched Dom talk about our development practices so I
can forget it all in time for next year's audit. :tada:

It did raise some questions about how we share knowledge within the team. We
have a playbook, but does anybody really use it, except for during onboarding?
Is that ok? If people aren't using it, where can we signpost things for people
where they _do_ look?

### allplants

[The first batch arrived!](/weeknotes/007) And there was a lot of it. Too much
to actually fit in the freezer thanks to misshapen blocks of frozen vegetables
being very space inefficient and some forgotten about lotus buns. But it's tasty
and, importantly, easy! We've has the gnocchi and the chilli and both were nice,
and far nicer than any ready meal I've ever had before. And decent portion
sizes, too.

### examining power

[You're not just a manager, you're also a boss](https://leaddev.com/professional-development/youre-not-just-manager-youre-also-boss)
(read it).

### ews1

So, remortgaging is probably not going to happen any time soon. Despite my
building being short, it has the bad kind of cladding, and the freeholder has no
interest in removing it and the leaseholders can't do anything about it without
the freeholder's permission. Lenders won't lend without an EWS1, which you can't
get with the bad cladding. Why is property ownership such a nightmare?!

### user manual for me

I did my semi-regular review of
[my user manual for me](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kpbgVi4=/) and made a few
tweaks as I learn a bit more about myself.

### week off

This week was A Lot. Glad I've got the week off next week. I'm very grateful for
my 4 weeks on, 1 week off, working pattern. It's the best pattern I've ever had.
